Abstract: Connecting Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to parametric design has been suggested as a way of facilitating performing environmental assessments in early design stages. However, no overviews of potential approaches and tools are available. Also, no evaluation frameworks adapted for parametric LCA tools are present. In order to guide the development of frameworks for environmental analysis by architects in the early design stage, the goal of this paper is to provide such a framework, and to use it for a review of available LCA plug-ins for the commonly used parametric design framework Grasshopper®. First, an evaluation framework for classification and characterisation based on workflow, adaptability, and required user knowledge was developed. Second, a tool inventory was performed, identifying 12 parametric LCA plug- ins. Finally, four of these plug-ins were further investigated using the developed evaluation framework, a user persona approach, and a simplified test case. The main defining feature of the tools identified was the level of LCA expertise integrated in the tools, and the allocation of responsibility for data entry and interpretation. A contrast was found between streamlined tools, and tools which provide more versatility. The overview of approaches can be used to guide the future development of parametric environmental analysis frameworks.

### A Benchmarking Framework for Parametric Building Performance Simulation Tools

Abstract: Implementing Building Performance Simulation (BPS) in a parametric design framework is a prevalent way of facilitating environmental assessments in early design stages. However, no up-to-date overviews of potential approaches are available, and no benchmarking frameworks adapted for parametric BPS tools are present. In this study, such a framework was developed and applied to investigate eleven available BPS tools for the parametric design framework Grasshopper®. The main defining feature of the tools identified was the level of BPS expertise integrated in the tools, and the allocation of responsibility for data entry and interpretation. A contrast was found between streamlined tools, and tools which provide more versatility. The overview of approaches can be used to guide the future development of parametric environmental analysis frameworks.
